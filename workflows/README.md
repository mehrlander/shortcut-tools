# workflows

Action chains as source. `{"label", "actions": [{"id", "p"}]}`, where `p` is
`WFWorkflowActionParameters` verbatim.

```bash
python3 tools/pack.py workflows/wiring-test.json   # prints a tappable link
```

Tapping runs `Copy-ActionFromClaude` on the device, which puts the actions on
the clipboard, ready to paste into any shortcut. Format in
[`docs/shortcuts-format-notes.md`](../docs/shortcuts-format-notes.md).

| Chain | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `wiring-test` | Anchors at offset 0 and 15, one producer feeding two consumers. The regression test for variable binding. |
| `copy-action-from-claude` | The receiver itself, in the format it delivers. Self-hosting. |
| `js-data-url` | Runs JavaScript on device by coercing a `data:text/html` URL to rich text. |
| `menu` | Three cases under one `GroupingIdentifier`, modes 0/1/1/1/2. |
| `sync-xhr-probe` | Whether that coercion waits for the network, and for which kind of request. Two lines, one tap. |
| `gh-recent-branches` | The branches you last committed on, as a picker that opens the chosen one. The worked example of a page doing real work. |

## Payloads live in `pages/`, not pasted into the chain

Anywhere a parameter takes a string, `{"$file": "pages/thing.html"}` reads that
file instead, resolved from the repository root. A chain that carries an HTML
payload therefore references the page rather than holding a copy of it, so the
page stays editable, testable in a browser, and reviewable as a diff. `pack.py`
resolves the directive before packing, so the plist only ever sees text.

```json
{ "id": "is.workflow.actions.gettext",
  "p": { "WFTextActionText": { "$file": "pages/xhr-probe.html" } } }
```

A missing path is a hard error rather than an empty payload, and a payload
containing a raw U+FFFC is refused, since it would arrive as an unbound anchor.

## Parameter shapes are load-bearing and only partly confirmed

`actions.json` holds a bare identifier for 772 of 810 actions, so a chain's `p`
is reconstructed rather than looked up. In `gh-recent-branches` the five actions
inherited from `js-data-url` are confirmed by a chain that runs; `runworkflow`,
`text.split`, `choosefromlist`, `text.replace`, and `openurl` are inferred from
the documented naming and are not yet device-checked. A wrong key does not fail
loudly. It pastes an action with an empty field, which is a two-tap fix in the
editor and worth watching for on first run.
